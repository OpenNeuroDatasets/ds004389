{"EEGCoordinateSystem":"Other","EEGCoordinateUnits":"mm","EEGCoordinateSystemDescription":"Custom ESG electrode placement. The reference electrode was placed over the 6th thoracic vertebra (TH6) and is the center of the coordinate system. One electrode was placed at the inion (Iz), one electrode was placed over the 1st cervical vertebra (SC1), and 17 electrodes were placed in a grid with its center at the 6th cervical vertebra (SC6). Another grid of 17 electrodes were placed over the lumbar spinal cord with its center over the 1st lumbar vertebra (L1). One electrode was placed over the 4th lumbar vertebra (L4). Three electrodes have no registered positions: i) the anterior cervical electrode placed supraglottically (AC), ii) the anterior lumbar electrode placed supraumbrally (AL), and iii) the electrode placed at Fz and referenced to TH6 (Fz-TH6). The distances between Iz and SC1, SC1 and SC6, SC6 and TH6, TH6 and L1, and L1 were for participants 001 to 021 estimated based on the average distances measured in participants 022,023, 024, and 026. Only for participants 022, 023, 024, and 026 the electrode placement is based on individual measurements, as in the other participants no such measurements were taken. All electrodes placed over the spinal cord start with the letter S except for those with anatomic positions."}
